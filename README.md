     - `save_data()`: Save the budget and expense data in Excel sheets.
     - `load_data()`: Load data from existing Excel sheets.
   
2. **`UI.py`**:
   - Handles user interaction by taking input and displaying outputs.
   
3. **`main.py`**:
   - Main file to initialize and run the entire application.
